# Flock

## What

Flock is an API on top of multiple notification services to overcome repetitive building and platform idiosyncrasies.


## Why 

- Standardized interface for communicating with many services
- You can use your favourite RESTful library, rather than instally many third-party libraries
- Flock provides various convenience functions for extending some services (for example, bulk sending of messages)
